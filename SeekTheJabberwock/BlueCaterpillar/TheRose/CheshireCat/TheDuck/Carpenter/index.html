		  <i>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
			  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
			  He left it dead, and with its head<br>
			  He went galumphing back.</i>

		  It's now time to SLAY the JABBERWOCK!  But do not fear! You have made many friends along the way!<br>
		  You've met many CHARACTERS across TIME who are IN ORDER to CUT the beast down!<br>
		  It is in this way that the secondary characters of the past and the NAMES before and behind them become the KEY characters of the present.<br>
		  Good luck!
