<h4>
MINILUV: Big Brother is watching you follow directions
The Party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated.
</h4>
1. Gather the following supplies: a deck of cards, and a pen. We're going to do a quick run-down of the history of cryptography.
2. Sort the cards in each suit, from highest to lowest, with Ace high. Place the cards face up, in 4 rows, one suit in each row. Order the suits alphabetically from top to bottom, and decreasing from left to right. Discard jokers if there are any.
3. For the Jack of diamonds, rotate the four cards adjacent forming a diamond counterclockwise. For the 5 of diamonds, rotate the four adjacent cards clockwise.
4. Swap the 7 of spades and the 9 of spades. An early form of cryptography was steganography. Today, leetspeak is a good example of that. In the last row, reading backwards, you should see 34crypti710n. Write ENCRYPTION on those cards, with two letters on the 10 of spades.
5. Look at the leftmost twelve cards. Spartans used a scytale to write an encoded message on a strip of parchment paper wound around a cylinder. Write THISISSPARTA left to right, top to bottom, on those twelve cards, then rearrange those cards in the order they would appear on the parchment.
6. The first substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher. Encrypt CAESAR with n=13, and since he was kingly, write it left to right on the cards, starting with the King that matches the first encrypted letter. When writing letters, skip over the cards you've already written on.
7. A monoalphabetic substitution cipher replaces each symbol with a single letter. One of our card values has no letters yet. Substitute those all for Ls.
8. In the top row, you should have nine cards with no letters on them. A Vigenere cipher encrypts the same letter differently each time based on the key. Using a Vigenere cipher with the key CPV, encrypt CODEBREAK and write the ciphertext left to right on these cards.
9. We're in Vegas, lucky you, you have a full house of letter-free 5's and 4's. Using a=J and b=X, write the letter X using a Bacon cipher on these cards.
10. Swap the 3 of spades and the 2 of spades, the 8 of clubs with the Ace of clubs, the 4 of hearts with the 2 of clubs, and the 9 of hearts with the Jack of clubs.
11. Take the three Xs in a row and swap them with the Ace of hearts, 10 of diamonds, and 10 of clubs, maintaining order.
12. In the bottom row, there are two Ns. Substitute these for Ts.
13. There are 8 cards with no letters written on them. Using a Playfair cipher, going clockwise, encrypt PLAYFAIR using the Playfair cipher's inventor's last name as the key, and write it on those cards.
14. There are two Ms. Flip these over so that they are Ws.
15. Swap the 6 of diamonds and the 6 of clubs, and swap the 4 of diamonds and the 2 of clubs.
16. An Enigma machine used rotors to change the letters encrypted each time. Shift down the tenth column from the left, and move the bottom card to the top.
17. Take the 6 of Spades, and encode it as a Navajo code talker would, replacing the existing letter with the first letter of the Navajo word.
18. Swap the two Kings in the second column with each other, and the two 9s in the 6th column with each other. Swap the Jack of Hearts and the 7 of Hearts.
19. Take the Ace of Hearts to be Alice, and the seven of Clubs to be Bob. Find their shared Diffie-Hellman secret, using p=23, q=5, and their secret inputs a,b the alphanumeric values of the current letters (e.g., A=1). Replace the existing letter on the 9 of clubs with the letter corresponding to the secret; and add 1 to the secret to get another letter to replace the inputs on Alice and Bob's cards.
20. Replace the letter on the 5 of diamonds with the letter from the card below it (do not modify the original card). Swap the 7 of hearts and the 9 of clubs with the 8 of diamonds and the 7 of diamonds, keep order.
21. RSA is a widely used public key cryptosystem. Take the value of the letter on the 6 of hearts and the 5 of spades, add 50 to both, and take these to be p and q. Using e=5, decrypt the message c=3281. Replace the letters on the two input cards with the letter corresponding to this value m.
22. Swap the Ace of Hearts with the card above it. Do a three-way swap: replace the 3 of hearts with the 6 of diamonds, the 2 of spades with the 3 of hearts, and the 6 of diamonds with the 2 of spades.
23. The famous sculpture Kryptos encodes a message by skipping n letters into the message and noting that down (it's very similar to a scytale). Suppose you're decrypting a message, and find just the beginning of Kryptos, KRYP, starting at the King of Hearts and skipping every other letter. Replace the existing letters on the cards.
24. Swap the Ace of clubs with the King of Clubs. Swap the Jack of Clubs with the 4 of diamonds. Do a three-way swap: replace the Queen of diamonds with the 4 of clubs, the 3 of clubs with the Queen of diamonds, and the 4 of clubs with the 3 of clubs.
25. The AES cipher has three main kinds of rounds. First, SubByte. Substitute the letter in the 1st row, 11th column with V; the letter in the 2nd row, 12th column with L; and the letters in the 4th row, 5th column with X. Next, ShiftRows. Swap the cards in the first three rows of the 11th column down by one, and take the card from the bottom and re-insert at the top. Last, MixColumns. In the 4th row, reorder the cards in columns 5-8 in the order (left to right): 7th, 8th, 6th, 5th.
26. Swap the King of hearts and the 8 of spades. Swap the 10 of clubs and the Queen of hearts. Do a three-way swap: replace the Ace of spades with the King of spades, the King of spades with the Queen of spades, and the Queen of spades with the Ace of spades (what a tumultuous family heritage!).
27. (Elliptic curves happened in here but they were hard to fit into this narrative.)
28. Post-quantum cryptography are cryptographic schemes that are thought to be safe from attacks using quantum computers. On the King of Spades, the Ace of Clubs, the 10 of clubs, and the 9 of spades, replace the letters with the name of a lattice-based system NTRU (you should notice one card already has the letter).
29. Swap the 10 of clubs and the Ace of clubs. These cards were so stubborn, they just need one last change - using a Caesar cipher, encrypt the letters on these cards by n=16.
30. If you followed the instructions above exactly, you should now still have a 13x4 grid of cards, each with a single letter on them. Reading left to right, top to bottom, extract a 52-letter string. Use this as a one-time pad, and decrypt the meta answers for Minitrue, Minipax, and Miniplenty, in that order, padded with Xs to create a 52-bit string, to find the answer to Miniluv.
