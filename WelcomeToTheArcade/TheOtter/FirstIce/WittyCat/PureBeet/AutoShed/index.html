			You've done well to make it this far - <br>
			&nbsp; just one more challenge remains.<br>
			Now that you have all ten pieces, <br>
			&nbsp; it seems proper we end where we began!<br>
			<br>
			My cabinets are all very special, <br>
			&nbsp;each with a very special name.<br>
			And when names and numerals come together,<br>
			&nbsp;we proceed to play my last game.<br>
			<br>
			A message revealed, to the one who succeeds<br>
			&nbsp; to play my game like a pro<br>
			A gravity jigsaw - in order they fall<br>
			&nbsp;Rotate, align, drop, clear rows!<br>
			<br>
			In the end, slot the Hero and they'll all disapear.<br>
			TETRIS! you'll shout, while I cheer!<br>

			It's possible you may have missed a piece - in which case I'd suggest tracing your steps up to this point.<br>
			Be sure to check around the cabinets - it's crazy what kind of stuff people lose in the arcade!<br><br>
